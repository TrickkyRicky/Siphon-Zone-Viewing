## Intro

<p align="left">
  This is an app that was created with React Native to solve the problem of watching anime, and reading novels or manga ad-free. Using<a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/" target="_blank">Apples Testflight</a> for IOS devices and 
  APK's for Android devices. There are 3 services for the application and they are all hosted through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>.

  Originally this application was called Siphon Manga, where you were only able to read manga on the app, due to the high demand for Anime, and Novels. I decided to rewrite the application to organize and have a scalable design for my users.
  The Backend of this application started with Node.js and Express, but with the rewrite, I decided to break the server architecture into microservices for better scalability in AWS. For the Animated content I use Spring Boot, for Manga I use Node.js, and for Novels Golang.
  I've chosen these select few languages to keep my skills in them retained and sharp for future updates and job opportunities.
